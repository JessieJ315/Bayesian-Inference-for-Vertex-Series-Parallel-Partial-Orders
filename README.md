# Bayesian-Inference-for-Vertex-Series-Parallel-Partial-Orders

This repository contains the code related to paper - Bayesian Inference for Vertex Series Parallel Partial Orders. All code is written in R. 

The file 'vspfun.R' contains the helper functions for VSPs and BDTs. The 'mcmc_tree.R' file writes the code for mcmc. 

The 'example.R' file is an example script to run the functions. We also provide a sample queue-structure data as 'sample_data.RData'.
